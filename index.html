             <p>A drawing tool focused on care through language and communication.When we communicate online it's hard to understand body language, words can be misunderstood, and things left unsaid. Online communication is interpreted in the time and context of each individual, and thus it's harder to connect with other people. I wanted to focus on creating this individualized space for care, with this canvas as an expression of the mind: excessive, jumbled, vibrant, and loud. It includes excerpts from poems I wrote so that the user can now create a derivative poem of their own with a myriad of different words. Users can also icorporate their own words and phrases to create an art piece and type into the box to decorate the page. There are a multitude of combinations that can be achieved through exploration and the palette can be cleared with "c".

      <h4><center>Thoughts</center></h4>
      <center><a href="" target="blank">Lorem Ipsum</a></center>

 <div class ="reading1">
    <p><font color="#fad2e5"> Reading 1: “Where Deer Stroll Peacefully Past Computers,” describes how technology is a neutral tool that can be wielded to affect society for better or for worse, and with the onset of the pandemic, many of societies’ infrastructures and institutions have proven to use technology in detrimental ways. The article describes the missing component in technological use as “care”. Technology isn’t being used to take care of people despite having the capabilities and advancements to do so. The article referenced ​All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, ​to allude to a world where technology is more harmonious with nature and where it doesn’t infringe upon our humanity. This article calls for a “technical reconstruction,” where we focus more on caring for each other. For me this article perfectly described the imbalance that technology has become. While technology provides the benefits of communication, efficiency, and fast and easy information, it has caused more harm than good in my opinion. The article described the ambivalence and lack of concern that many people presented while many suffered and died because of the virus. I think a big part of this issue of “care” begins with technology itself too, as the digital age has created a huge disconnect in human connections, interactions and way of being. Technology not only plays on the weaknesses of human psychology, but it also has become extremely commercialized where people care more about money than the individuals using the devices. The second article describes a cybernetic library, creating a network system of physical, digital, and abstract interactions to serve as a kind of social community. This idea seems to be a sort of solution to the disharmony that technology has created, recording essays, art, and work of a myriad of people and allowing others to interact with it. It creates a symbiotic relationship with technology as it allows one to use it in a more beneficial and sacred way. Questions: We’re so deep into the technological age, could things still change for the future? Is it possible for us to have a healthy balance with technology on a national or global scale again? Are we currently experiencing the dystopia that people are so afraid of? Is it possible to have a balanced relationship with technology without it negatively affecting your work or social life, or your relevance today?</p></center>

     <p><font color="#fad2e5"> Reading 2: Diana Nucera, also known as Mother Cyborg, combines her passion for community organizing into performances of art installations, innovative technology,  and music. She spoke about the digital divide in Detroit, and her work establishing the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition, which focused on providing access, participation, common ownership, and healthy communities with the use of media and technology, because with a healthy balance it is essential to a thriving community. She used this idea of creating a healthy digital ecosystem and applied it to other locations. I really liked what she said about the importance of technology and the media and building a balanced ecosystem for communities lacking access. We often think of technology and are privileged enough to study it and debate it’s negative qualities but it is important to remember how much it shapes society and that some people are being left out.
    The Virtual Care lab contains an extremely interactive website dedicated to remote connection for creative expression, purposeful online relationships, presence, and digital well-being. The website felt very fun and free, and  also offered events, activities, and different realms to explore. I loved the concept because it provided a comforting and stress relieving internet presence that is often hard to find. Cloud 9 hosted a similar platform focused on support and love during the pandemic. They organized mutual aid resources, events, and places to donate to support people affected by the pandemic. It was a really honorable and community driven way to combat a relevant issue.Discussion Questions: 1. How would you be able to survive without wifi and internet? What are some technology benefits  that you might not think about often but are essential to you? 2. Can you think of other ways that technology and community infrastructures depend on each other? 3. What’s a website that you enjoy that provides a healthy space for communication and education online?</p></center>

      <p><font color="#fad2e5"> Reading 3: Cyberfeminism focuses to re-make cyberspaces and new media to defy established power structures, integrate women’s history with technology, and redefine women in the media. I really enjoyed the cyberfeminism index because it compiled important documents throughout history in a timeline format and created a library for education and digital mapping. I think this is a brilliant way to track progress and spread their message which aligns with the movements overall goals. One that I found interesting was the 100 Anti-Theses, which declared things that cyberfeminism is not some important one’s I thought: romantic, a wound, a single woman, a trauma, complete. Data feminism acknowledges the activism that was required for many women to gain rightful credit for their accomplishments, and the intersectionality of feminism that has moved women to fight against the male dominated systems and work environments. I read the chapter On Rational, Scientific, Objective Viewpoints From Mythical, Imaginary, Impossible Standpoints. The chapter focused on elevating emotion and embodiment and recognizing the wisdom from being alive and feeling. I really identified with this because our society has such an emphasis on book knowledge as a means to determine intelligence when it’s way deeper and more complex and individualized than that. They described this as a false binary between emotion and reason which is true because the two are intrinsically linked. Regardless this idea permeates and benefits men. I also really enjoyed their description of the visceralization of data to be experienced through the whole body and emotions. She Who Sees The Unknown: The Archive, is a beautiful collection of manuscripts, artwork, books, and research. What I loved the most was the way that the content was styled and organized that contributed to the overall goals of the project to steer away from colonial power relations. They did this really successfully and built a welcoming and educational space to “re-figure” female, and non-binary/queer figures.1. What are other ways we could incorporate cyberfeminism into schools and the general society and make it more accessible? 2. What are other gendered binaries similar to the emotion/reason one that are myth but still permeate our society? 3. What stuck out to you the most about cyberfeminism and why?

       <p><font color="#fad2e5"> Reading 4: I enjoyed the resource “Building Consentful Tech,” which described having control and autonomy over our bodies online to foster a culture based on consent. I hadn’t thought much about consent in a media context, though it is an extremely prevalent issue that we don’t have much control over today. It is essential that we have a say in our data, information and digital bodies online, and framing this concept in the form of ‘consent’ is a very smart and powerful way to discuss the issue. They discussed the criteria of consent and the truth behind the word. It was important that they described it as a community and ongoing process and that we need to hold each other accountable. I also really liked the other sites about surveillance capitalism and creating more accessible and welcoming environments online for all bodies. I think these are great resources to start     building a big conversation. Questions: 1. A lot of information has already been so dispersed online, is it possible to ever gain autonomy over our digital bodies? 2. Do any of the criteria of consent contradict the way the media naturally works? 3. What are ways we can adapt consent and accommodate for our technological environment?

     <div class ="reading5">
        <p><font color="#fad2e5"> Reading 5: Reading 5: I am very inspired by indigenous technology and its characteristics. I think this is a really powerful way of spreading knowledge and educating people about indigenous culture. I liked how they described it as an “ecology that supports revitalization” and the whole idea of a rebirth and renewal of culture on a multi-dimensional platform. It was nice having it organized with a timeline archive at the top to provide experiences throughout time. I only wish that there was more awareness of sites like this because I think it would be really educational and beneficial for more people to interact with these experiences. I enjoyed how the article on postcolonial computing described opening up familiar research for experimentation and discovery instead of falling into traditional patterns. This is a really important tactic in viewing history and culture because knowledge is often not very beneficial if it can’t be applied,  investigated, and explored rather than just accepted without engaging with the past and thinking about it in the context of the present. Questions: What’s something about indigenous technology that you were surprised by? In what ways did the Indigenous technology site engage with postcolonial computing? Are there any personal experiences or articles you’ve read that would benefit from postcolonial computing and its theories?

      <div class ="reading7">
         <p><font color="#fad2e5"> Reading 7:  Reading 7: The Enchanting Music of Sign Language by Christine Sun Kim was one of the best Ted Talks I’ve seen in a while. I really liked how she described how sound isn’t just experienced in one way, and that you can feel it, see it, imagine it, and that a musical note can’t be fully expressed and captured on paper, similar to ASL. She described her time visiting an art museum when all of the exhibits were sound based and there was no visual art. This made her feel distanced from art, but then she realized that sound is much more dimensional and that she knows sound, even though society makes it seem as if there is only one way to experience it. Her example with the ‘p’ note from piano was a great analogy for no matter how quiet you go there is always sound. This caused her to start her journey of taking ownership of sound and allow ASL to develop it’s currency. This whole concept was very inspiring to me because I’ve always understood that systems  no matter how excepted and ubiquitous they become, weren’t made for everyone. This is the essence of cognitive and inclusive design. I also really enjoyed the article on designing for cognitive differences, because as someone who has Bipolar disorder I understand how society can be extremely un-accommodating most of the time. I would say the world isn’t built for most people and it’s important to think about these differences when designing especially when they will be absorbed by a larger audience. Questions : 1. Is it possible to design completely inclusive spaces or will someone always feel disconnected? How will things change among major technologies if the people producing the products aren’t the ones affected by the issue? 2.Do you see any similarities of Critical Access to Design Justice? 3.What improvements could you see/imagine in society if design became more inclusive and more attune to people’s differences?
