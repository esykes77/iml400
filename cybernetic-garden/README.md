# Cybernetic Garden

After reading “All watched Over By Machines of loving Grace,” by Richard Brautigan, I was inspired to make my website a “cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature, [and] returned to our mammal brothers and sisters”. I decided to do this by creating a network of some of the “flower” pictures I have on my camera roll throughout the years, how they connect to each other, and bring me back to my humanity and nature within myself. I chose flowers because they bloom and grow, and I wanted to focus on the relationship between time, growth, and my relationship to technology. In doing this I discovered that my camera roll itself has allowed me to have a balanced relationship with tech, as I have been able to capture many beautiful moments and make them tangible, shareable, and eternal.
